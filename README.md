# TriviaGame
Justice League trivia game.
I used jQuery to handle click events, listening for dyncamically created events, and all dyncamic elements.

Take a look at the comments on the app.js to see what each function does

I took a shot at object oriented programming and made the game an object so I could run methods on the object instead of a functional approach with standalone functions to run the game.
